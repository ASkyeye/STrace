Dtrace embedds a complete syscall argument count and type metadata table. This is used internally by dtrace's StpGetArgType which is invoked when running dtrace -lv to list probe arguments. This table I didn't bother reversing the binary format of, instead this is a parser to convert the output of dtrace -lv into json. This is maybe better in case the binary format changes, but worse if the dtrace installation becomes more complex. Time will tell if this needs re-done, for now just run the command then the python parse to make the json list.
